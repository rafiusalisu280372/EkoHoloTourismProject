1. Abstract

Tourism is one of the important factors for economic and social development of Lagos cities today. It is important that local and foreign tourists get information about the important areas and places of tourism and how to reach those places. If this information can be retrieved up-to-date and instantaneously, this will significantly increase the satisfaction of the tourists. Use of augmented reality technology for innovation in day-to-day life is getting increasingly broad. This innovation is additionally being applied in the field of the travel industry. Currently, the model of portable mobile application for enhancing the use of technology in the travel industry has been created by utilizing enlarged augmented reality innovation.The necessities, the skills and deficiency of the strategies is portrayed. This application expects to give interactivity to the client when the item gets distinguished so more data can be viewed. Unity 3D software with Vuforia Engine will be used for implementing augmented reality technology and also Android application development tools such as Android Studio will be used for development of the mobile application. Keywords: augmented reality,tourism,application

The aim to design and develop the project is to produce a tourist guide application to facilitate domestic and international tourists. This tourist guide project is an Android application which uses augmented reality to provide more interactivity to the users’ view. When the augmented reality technology is applied in it, information like the location, road map, ratings and nearby important places which are related to the current area will be displayed on the phone’s display by using the camera. The users will have more consistent information about their target location. The application of augmented reality technology in tourism will have an important contribution for the transformation of Mr Gov THEMES smart city agenda and could lead to future interactive applications. The application will help to provide modern technology to boost tourism. 

2. Project Introduction

EkoHoloTour is a project that focuses on building a mixed reality system that gives tourists access to every possible tourist attraction in Lagos state. The major aim of this project is to bring users to that space where they have a relatable visual experience of places they could tour in Lagos before visiting physically in order to enrich their expectations and give them useful information they may require before visiting. The aim is to produce a tourist guide application to facilitate domestic and international tourists.The application will have a simple,easy to use GUI(Graphical User Interface) so that it can be utilized by everyone. This tourist guide project is an Android application which uses augmented reality to provide more interactivity to the users’ view. When the augmented reality technology is applied in it, the camera opened inside the application helps to detect objects . 



Proposed System Architecture

3. Project Scope

EkoHoloTour project centers around building a system that captures information of tourist attractions within Lagos environs and is accessible to all. This project will in the following phases:
●    Phase 1: Adventure and amusement centers:
- Beaches, Resorts, tropical island, hiking and camping in national parks etc
●    Phase 2: Cultural tourist attraction:
- Historical places, monuments, zooes, aquarials, museums, ethnic enclave communities
●    Phase 3: Buildings and structures:
- Aged buildings, library, team parks, open spaces, work stations, in-state industries and companies etc
●    Phase4: Recreation:
- Hotels and restaurants, fast food joints, clubs, gym houses, art galleries.

Other insights that can be gotten from the outcome of the project are:

●    Location and overview of place of interest
●    Cost of visiting and available services
●	Visual insight on what to expect from physical tour and real time interaction with place of interest
●    A feedback system that allow tourists document their experiences, upload
pictures/short video clip of moments for the improvement of tourist centers so that the government can make adequate provisions for visitors

4. Technologies Used : 

 Unity 3D Editor - Unity is a cross-platform game engine. It was developed and released by Unity Technologies in the year 2005.

             Sample Case study of the tool above can be illustrated in the picture below :

 

 Vuforia SDK- Vuforia utilizes computer vision for identifying and tracking images. By using this feature we can create virtual objects which are positioned and tracked with respect to the identified real world objects.

Wikitude SDK - For identification and tracking 3D objects and surroundings the Wikitude SDK for Unity has been used. Using the images of the scene an object file is generated using this we can recognize the scene and augment virtual objects which are positioned and oriented according to the real world.

5. Project Schedule

The project is scheduled to run from building to implementation phase throughout the course of the hololearns training, a 12 week training period.
